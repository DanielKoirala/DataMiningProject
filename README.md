# DataMiningProject

Need to have python and pip installed. I'd recommend directory structure as DataMining-> DataMiningProject. Set up venv under the DataMining directory not the DataMiningProject directory
so it doesn't include the files on the repo.

Set-up venv:
python -m venv venv
source /venv/bin/activate

Install the following dependencies and packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk flask matplotlib

Running the code:

python src/preprocess.py
python src/train.py
